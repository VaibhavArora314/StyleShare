# Setting Up on your machine ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Go to the backend folder and create a .env file
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="Mongodb Connection String here"
    JWT_SECRET="secret"
    PORT=3001
    ```
2. Run the following commands in the backend folder
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run dev
    ```
    The npm run build cmd will handle the Prisma migrations, and also build the frontend folder which will be served by the express server.
    
    Possible Problems:
    - Prisma may give error for MongoDB replica set, in such case use Mongodb atlas for the database instead of the local database or start a Mongo docker container with the replica set.
3. In case you are modifying the frontend and you want hot module reloading, then run the following commands in the frontend directory
    ```
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    Also, set the default base URL of the backend (don't push this to GitHub) or simply uncomment the following:
